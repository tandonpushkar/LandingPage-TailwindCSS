## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility first CSS framework that enables rapid CSS development — it’s basically a set of CSS classes that we can apply on HTML tags to get results and try things quickly. I am sure you have used bootstrap at some point of time and you know for responsiveness, bootstrap has classes like row, col and col-lg-2. Apply and forget.
